        <h2>Batman</h2>
        <p>The protector of Gotham City. A tortured, brooding vigilante dressed as a bat who fights against evil and strikes fear into the hearts of criminals everywhere.</p>
        <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Batman's intense lifestyle and training has granted him strength. He is well versed in martial arts and it's his primary form of combat. He fights with a mixture of powerful styles and gadgets. He is also incredibly rich.</p>
        <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Due to his trauma of his parent's deaths, he is highly susceptible to emotional despair. He won't use a gun because his parents were killed right in front of him.</p>

      <div class="lev-text">
        <h2>Levi Ackerman (AOT)</h2>
        <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Levi's conviction allows him to take actions other heroes may not be comfortable with. He can cut down anyone over 6ft with murderous efficiency. This illustrates the deceptively high physical force at Ackermann's disposal.</p>
        <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Levi is debilitated through the guilt of his failures. He is 5'3" because of his malnourishment as a child. He cannot wear heavy armor since it would compromise his mobility, rendering him an easy mark if targeted successfully.</p>

      <div class="nar-text">
        <h2>Naruto Uzumaki</h2>
        <p>A young shinobi who has made astounding leaps of progress and power over his life.</p>       
        <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Over the years, Naruto has mastered toad summoning, the rasengan, sage mode, and the shadow clone jutsu. He has fantastic creativity in combat, and often relies on his deceptively high intelligence to locate weaknesses in enemies.</p>       
        <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> While Sage mode may be the most powerful tool in Naruto's arsenal, it takes time to gather nature chakra from the area around him before converting it to physical strength. He is also irrationally forgiving.</p>

    <div class= "aang">
      <div class="aan-image">
        <img src="images/Aang.jpg" alt="aang">
      </div>

      <div class="aan-text">
        <h2>Aang</h2>
        <p>A young quadra-elemental bender frozen in an iceberg who turn into a fully-fledged Avatar through guidance.</p>
        <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Aang might be young, but he was raised by people who taught him strong principles and ethics. He mastered all four elements (water, air, earth, and fire) from skilled teachers. He was also able to control the Avatar State and valued all life.</p>
        <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> One of Aang’s overall biggest weaknesses was his immaturity and lack of experience. His compassion and gentleness was a tool for his enemies to use against him. He wasn’t good at taking criticism, and he needed a lot of positive reinforcement.</p>
