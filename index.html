        <h2>Batman</h2>
        <p>The superhero protector of Gotham City, a tortured, brooding vigilante dressed as a bat who fights against evil and strikes fear into the hearts of criminals everywhere.</p>
        
        <p> <strong>Strength:</strong> Strength: Batman's intense lifestyle and training has granted him strength that is on an absolutely monstrous level, he is able to easily crush heavily dense items such as metal and stone with his bare body strength.He is well versed in martial arts, it is his primary form of combat. He fights with a mixture of intensely powerful styles of martial arts and is incredibly skilled with it.</p> 
         
         <p> <strong>Weakness:</strong> Weakness: Due to his horrifying past traumas of his parent's deaths, he is highly susceptible to emotional despair.He won't use a gun to protect and he won't use a gun to kill, his parents were killed and shot down right in front of him so his fear to use a gun is very apparent.</p>



        <h2>Levi Ackerman (AOT)</h2>
        <p> <strong>Strength:</strong> Strength: Levi's conviction allows him to take necessary measures that many of the series' other heroes may not be comfortable with.He has never struggled with cutting down giants and could do so with murderous efficiency.This illustrates the deceptively high physical force at Ackermann's disposal.</p>
       
       
        <p> <strong>Weakness:</strong> Weakness: Levi is debilitated through the guilt of his failures.He Isn't as Strong of a Leader as he is a warrior,his skills do not sufficiently translate into leadership.He cannot wear heavy armor since it would compromise his mobility, rendering him an easy mark if targeted successfully.</p>
       
       
       
        <h2>Naruto Uzumaki</h2>
        <p>Naruto was the titular protagonist of the Naruto series and a young shinobi who has made astounding leaps of progress over his seven-hundred-episode journey.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Strength: Naruto is the series' most powerful hero. Over the years, he has mastered toad summoning, the rasengan, sage mode, and his iconic ability, the shadow clone jutsu. He has fantastic creativity in combat, often relying on his deceptively high intelligence in order to locate weaknesses in enemies and exploit them.</p>
        
        <p> <strong>Weakness:</strong> Weakness: While Sage mode may be the most powerful tool in Naruto's arsenal, it has serious limits - time must be spent gathering nature chakra from the area around him before concentrating it into physical strength. As an idealistic hero, he has a martyr complex that has put him in grave jeopardy before.He is so irrationally forgiving that he attempts to absolve almost every villain he crosses the path of, using their difficult pasts to justify and excuse their actions.
        </p>


        <h2>Aang</h2>
        <p>Aang from Avatar: The Last Airbender is the hero of the story. As the main protagonist, the series centers around his narrative arc from the boy lost in the iceberg to a fully-fledged Avatar who restores balance to the world.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Strength: Aang might be barely a pre-teen, but he was raised by people who taught him strong principles and ethics. He mastered all the four elements (Water, Air, Earth, and Fire) from teachings by his superior and was able to control the Avatar State at all times. He valued all life and was taught that taking a life is a serious thing to do. </p>
        
        <p> <strong>Weakness:</strong>  Weakness: One of Aang’s overall biggest weaknesses was his immaturity and lack of experience. His compassion and gentleness was often a strength, but it was more of a weakness for his enemies to use against him. He wasn’t good at taking criticism, and he needed a lot of positive reinforcement.
